# TODO

- [FIX] add loading component for any component using fetch
- [FEATURE] grey background for avatar when loading
- [FEATURE] if user has loaded entire tidbits, when navigating back
  to tidbits, it should load all of them. Or have lazy loading.
- Refactor to GET request for caching, once this issue has been resolved > https://github.com/nuxt/content/issues/664
- Remove open sidebar in bigger screens
- Make responsive grid, so it fits row if possible
- [FIX] if using duration, need to make sure `transition` is included
- turn pictorial page to 3 col (toc on side)

## Ready

- pictorials: add block code
- add min height when loading, so no jump
- install https://github.com/egoist/vue-content-loader

## Doing
