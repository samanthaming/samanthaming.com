# Day 5: Flexbox Module

Let's zoom in on one of the layouts and check out the anatomy of our Flexbox. On each axis, there is a start and an end.  If it's on the main axis, the starting position is called **main start** and if the ending position is called **main end**. The same concept applies to the cross axis. Knowing your start and end is important because you can control where your flex items are placed.

And this concludes our Flexbox Fundamentals.
