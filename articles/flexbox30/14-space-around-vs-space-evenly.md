# Day 14: space-around vs space-evenly

You might not notice the subtle difference between space-around and space-evenly. So let's talk about it. In space-evenly, the empty space in between the flex items is always equal. However, in space-around, only the inner items will have equal spacing in between each other. The first and last item will only be allocated half the spacing. Giving the visual appearance of it being more spread out. One may say these folks like to live life on the edge 😂
