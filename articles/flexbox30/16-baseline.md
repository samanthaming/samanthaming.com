# Day 16: baseline

The baseline value is a bit tricky. So let's make sure we understand what that is. Baseline has to do with typography or text. It is the imaginary line where the text sits. If you have the same font size, you really don't visually see a difference. However when you have different font sizes, then the text seems all over the place because the baseline is off. The way to ensure a uniform baseline where all the different sizes of text can rest on is to use the baseline value 👍
