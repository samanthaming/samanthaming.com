Welcome to my first newsletter! I know this
isn't a real proper newsletter as there is no way to sign up. I'm
working on it though! I just want to test this series and
see what you all think first.

I've been sharing my developer journey in my IG story. But I want to start sharing them here now. It will be a behind the scene look of my journey to becoming a Senior Developer. There will be highs and lows. It's going to be raw -- I won't be sugarcoating anything. I hope by sharing my experience, you might find some commonalities in navigating your journey 💛
